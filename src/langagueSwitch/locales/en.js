    <h1 className={styles.title}>What is good and what is bad?</h1>
    <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
      The little son came to his father,<br />
      and the little one asked:<br />
      <em>What is good and what is bad?</em><br />
      <strong>— V.V. Mayakovsky</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      This child's question seems simple at first glance, but behind it lies a deep philosophical dilemma.
      What does it really mean to do good? The entire history of humanity is full of contradictions and moral dilemmas.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Historical Context</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Imagine an ancient tribe leader. He gathered his band, attacked a neighboring tribe, destroyed all the men
      and elders, and enslaved the women and children. From the standpoint of modern Christian morality, this is clearly
      villainy. But the descendants of this leader, centuries later, may proudly consider their ancestor a great conqueror.
      Thanks to his actions, their society was able to survive and prosper. Ironically, they pray to Jesus,
      who preached love and forgiveness.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Modern Parallels</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      In the modern world, methods of appropriating someone else's labor have become more sophisticated, but the essence remains the same.
      Corporations absorb small businesses, economically strong countries exploit the resources of the weak.
      This brings good to some and misery to others. Even within one group of people, what is good for one may
      be bad for another.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Boundaries of Good and Evil</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      So how do we define what is good for everyone? Everything is too situational and subjective. But let's
      look at it from another perspective: what is definitely evil?
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Death has always frightened people, and each person tries to compensate for this fear in their own way. Murder under certain
      conditions may be seen as good, but the death of all humanity is absolute evil. Actions
      that reduce humanity's chances of survival can be considered evil. Hence, everything that
      increases these chances is good.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Conclusion</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Therefore, I suggest we view moral questions through this lens: any action that contributes
      to the survival and flourishing of humanity can be considered good. This gives us a practical criterion
      for evaluating actions.
    </p>

    chapter2:`
    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Moral Dilemmas</h2>
    <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
      God, grant me the strength to overcome what is necessary,<br />
      God, grant me the humility to accept the inevitable,<br />
      And the wisdom to distinguish between the two.<br />
      <strong>— My interpretation of a well-known prayer.</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      At first glance, the statement that any actions that increase the chances of humanity's survival are good seems logical and pragmatic. 
      However, this statement requires a more detailed analysis.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Saving a Part of Society:</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      When it comes to humanity's survival, the situation can be quite straightforward. If the choice is between the extinction of all or saving 
      at least part of the reproductively capable population, then the good lies in saving this part. This may seem harsh, but in extreme situations, 
      such a choice becomes necessary. An example could be a global catastrophe scenario, where, in order to continue the human race, at least 
      a minimum number of people must be preserved.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Violation of Rights and Freedoms</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Definition of Freedom:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      The question of what freedom is is complex and multifaceted. In various situations, people are forced to sacrifice their rights and freedoms 
      for survival. At work, for example, we temporarily transfer some of our rights to our bosses to secure a livelihood.
      In different countries, there are restrictions on the display of certain body parts, and these restrictions vary depending on 
      cultural norms. People can only gain true freedom when they become independent from society, but this is unlikely in real 
      life conditions.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Long-term Consequences</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Unpredictability of the Future:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      We are not gods and cannot foresee all the consequences of our actions. Sometimes actions that seem good in the short term 
      can result in negative consequences in the future. However, this should not stop us from striving for survival.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Psychological and Sociocultural Aspects</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Culture and the Being of Society:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Culture, in essence, should serve the being of society, not be its foundation. Although the impoverishment of culture may seem 
      like an important issue, it should not overshadow the pursuit of survival. The most important aspect that deserves attention is 
      adherence to social justice. This is one of the cornerstones of society, and later in the book, we will examine it in more detail.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Thus, actions aimed at increasing the chances of humanity's survival can be considered good. 
      But unfortunately, we are not immediately able to definitively determine which actions lead to the desired result. 
      For that, we must use our reason to anticipate some problems.

  <h1 className={styles.title}>Honesty and Lies</h1>
  <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
    A certain odd fellow still fights for the Truth,<br />
    The Truth in his words is worth no more than a penny:<br />
    <em>Pure Truth will triumph over time —<br />
    If it does the same as blatant Lies!</em><br />
    <strong>— Vladimir Vysotsky</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Everyone lies. This is obvious: distorting information becomes a convenient tool for personal gain.
    Through lies, one can avoid punishment for bad deeds, make less effort, and reap undeserved benefits.
    Humanity today is so powerful that it can fully compensate for the laziness of hundreds of millions of lazy liars
    and partially for billions more. Lies are a great tool for an easy life.
  </p>

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Cost of Lies</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    However, anyone who distorts information creates an imbalance in the social structure.
    Without knowing the real picture of resource production and misallocating these resources among consumers,
    society is doomed to face a crisis sooner or later. Historically, overcoming such crises often involves unpleasant
    forms of taking others' labor, including war in one form or another.
  </p>

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>What to Do?</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    Therefore, I see the elimination of the imbalance caused by pervasive lies as one of the steps toward survival.
    But I do not advocate for an absolute ban on lies, as benevolent lies indeed exist, and one must know how to use them
    and understand when good becomes harm.
  </p>

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Truth or Honesty?</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    The method of fighting for survival that I have chosen is to tell the truth. Not the absolute truth, for only God knows that.

chapter4: `
  <h1 className={styles.title}>And How Did I See God in the Sky?</h1>
  <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
    And how did I see God in the sky?<br />
    My heart must have been mistaken?<br />
    Does that mean the road to heaven is closed?<br />
    I didn’t see myself behind God…<br />
    <strong>— Pavel Plamenyev</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    How I wish God existed. Just imagine how wonderful that would be:
    He would surely take care of us, help us get food, provide warmth and happiness.
    He would punish bad people.
    It sounds wonderful, doesn’t it? It doesn’t matter that you’ve never seen God — if you have even one of the above,
    then He must be working, right?
    You haven’t seen proof that He doesn’t exist, so maybe He does exist?
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    This is all true. But to fully answer the question of God's existence, you need to understand why it is asked.
    This question becomes relevant when you are confused. You don’t understand why to keep living?
    You don’t know why things are going wrong? You fear that life may have no meaning? You want to believe that everything
    will be fine in the end?
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    If in order to live on and be useful to society, you need to believe in God — then believe.
    But remember: all blessings and all evil, all justice and injustice come from people.
    It is society that can give you everything you need.
    And since society performs God's duties, it turns out that God, or at least His representative on earth, exists.

<p className={styles.text}>
  Society, assembly, group — in our world, there are many words in all languages 
  describing the phenomenon of people uniting for joint actions. But how do these societies differ? 
  What actions do they take? The difference seems small, 
  but each society has something unique — for every good action against all negative ones.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>Why do we need society?</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
  Why do people need society? The answer lies in the simple truth — it is easier to survive together. 
  Many millennia ago, people realized that staying outside of society meant being doomed. 
  There are exceptions, but they only prove the rule — without society, a person faces death and oblivion. 
  This deep desire to unite leads people to form societies. 
  There may be various situational deviations caused by manipulations or traditions, 
  but any society that does not care for its members is doomed to die.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>How to distinguish the right society?</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
  To distinguish the right direction of society from the wrong one, we again have to turn to the concept of good. 
  A society that increases the chances of humanity's survival is acting correctly. 
  If it does actions that reduce or deprive humanity of survival chances, it is going the wrong way.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>Principles of society</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
  From all that has been said, it follows that every society must adhere to two principles:
</p>
<ol className={styles.list}>
  <li>Caring for society's members (and thus increasing the chances for the survival of humanity as a whole).</li>
  <li>Protecting the structure of society (a society without established levers of interaction, in other words, power, is also doomed).</li>
</ol>

chapter6: `
  <h1 className={styles.title}>Power doesn't come from the people!</h1>
  <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
    Don't repeat these foolish ideas written in the Constitution!<br />
    Power is maintained by the strength of warriors, not the cries of the crowd<br />
    And through its executions!<br />
    <strong>— Pavel Plamenyev</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    For a society that wishes to continue its existence, there must be a structure through which the individuals 
    who make up the society can interact with each other. This structure in our language can be called power. 
    Power is primarily the ability of one individual to make another individual carry out their desire.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Power can be considered by the nature of its origin, but in any case, regardless of its origin, its implementation 
    depends primarily on the belief of those being governed that it is correct.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    If you need money, and you go to work for it, you are being made to perform certain actions necessary for someone else. 
    Money is a way of transferring power impulses. One person wants another person to do something, and pays them for it. 
    Essentially, money is one of the ways to exercise power.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Another way of exercising power is belief. A faith leader believes their followers should perform certain actions. 
    It doesn't matter what those actions are — what matters is that, in the end, one individual imposes their desires onto another.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    And in both the case of money and belief, the main motive is to make people believe that they need to act according 
    to someone else's will. Essentially, money is as much a matter of belief as Christian religions, for example. 
    There are many such examples. And with every example, the same fact becomes clear — power exists when people believe in it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Power is impossible when a person knows that they can get what they want without it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Power is possible when a person believes that without it they won't get what they need.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The question is, is it good or bad that some people submit to others? 
    Every time this question arises, it's worth considering what has caused it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The issue is that group labor is much more efficient than individual labor. Any healthy person is capable of mastering 
    any part of any production chain, but no one is capable of doing everything, let alone making everything. For example, 
    to hunt a mammoth, it needs to be struck 300 times in 1 minute. No single person could manage this alone; a group of people 
    is needed to strike simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    How do you do it? Our ancestors came up with dividing roles between commanders and subordinates 
    (regardless of what they were called at the time) as the simplest solution. At the command to strike, 
    a group successfully kills a mammoth. They have food — the function of power is complete, and power can retreat until new 
    organizational efforts are needed. But this worked only as long as the results of the labor were known to those performing it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    But if, for example, building a house requires 1000 bricks, the manager can easily convince subordinates 
    that they need to make 1100 bricks. As a result, more labor is spent, the group gets the same benefit (the house), 
    and the manager is left with 100 bricks to do whatever they want with.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Essentially, for power to remain intact, it must constantly perform a useful societal function of management for the survival 
    of that society (this goal is the primary goal of any society). All other goals of society are imposed by its own power.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    To fulfill the desires of an individual, power is applied in society.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Or, to fulfill an individual's desires, society must believe that those desires should be fulfilled.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    If society has no issues with basic needs, an individual can use the belief of this society to achieve goals beyond the 
    desires of that society, according to their own personal views.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The question of the legitimacy of power arises when:
    <br />
    1. Basic desires of society are unmet
    <br />
    2. The desires of other powerful members of society are unmet.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    In the first case, the individual with power has used it unwisely, squandering it on their own desires at the expense of society.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    In the second case, another individual desires additional power to fulfill their own desires.

  </blockquote>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Previously, we discussed two important questions about the nature of power and virtuous actions.
    Now it's time to focus on what drives people to act in one way or another.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Desire. There was a comrade Freud, who always sought the "animal" component in the motivations of human
    actions, and undoubtedly, this component is present directly or indirectly in many human actions (for
    example, as a result of morning runs, a person gains control over certain physical parameters, which in
    turn leads to increased attention from the opposite sex, which in turn increases the chances of satisfying
    the desire for reproduction). However, there are actions that are explicitly directed at the self-destruction
    of the society in which the specific person lives, or at the elimination of the person from the competitive
    struggle within that society.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Most often, such desires are caused by manipulations with human consciousness, where a "correct" behavior
    is created in a person's mind in ways that contradict basic "instincts". Ultimately, such destructive behavior
    serves to satisfy other people's "animal" instincts at the expense of individuals who voluntarily withdraw from
    the competitive struggle after falling for manipulation. Our nature, through feelings, gives us an understanding
    of what we need, and the awareness of these feelings is what gives rise to Desires.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    As a result, every person has their own vision of the situation and the desired transformation of it into
    a sequence of events where the person will be better off. If a person cannot properly determine what is
    happening, they will not be able to understand what needs to be done to get the desired outcome. One form
    of power, and the most skillful among them all, is the power over desires. If manipulations with wages, 
    intimidation with force, or fear of the afterlife judgment are more or less clear to society, and the method
    of combating these manipulations is conceptually understood, though not yet fully resolved, the struggle with
    false desires has not only not begun, but is also not recognized by society in its mass. Undoubtedly, we cannot
    say that the formation of Desires in society is organized in the worst possible way, but if society's eyes
    are not opened to the lie it lives by and for, it will eventually lead to an imbalance in resource distribution
    among people, and since humanity is becoming more powerful, the risk of self-destruction is increasing.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    To prevent our extinction as a species, society must get rid of false desires. To form viable desires,
    truth is needed — on the basis of which each person will make a choice for themselves. And if a person is not
    mentally ill, they will certainly make the right choice. They will certainly have the right desires.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    How to distinguish a right desire from a wrong one? To do this, you can trace the chain of connections
    until it becomes clear which of the instincts will be satisfied as a result of fulfilling a certain desire.
    If one of your instincts is not satisfied, it means that someone else's desire is being fulfilled. And then
    you can decide whether it is worth desiring what you currently want.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    After all, people by nature possess such a trait as laziness, and would rather not do something unnecessary
    than do it. Therefore, any action must be justified at least from the position of laziness, not to mention
    some personal or common good.
