    <h1 className={styles.title}>What is good and what is bad?</h1>
    <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
      The little son came to his father,<br />
      and the little one asked:<br />
      <em>— What is good and what is bad?</em><br />
      <strong>— V.V. Mayakovsky</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      This child's question seems simple at first glance, but behind it lies a deep philosophical dilemma.
      What does it really mean to do good? The entire history of humanity is full of contradictions and moral dilemmas.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Historical Context</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Imagine an ancient tribe leader. He gathered his band, attacked a neighboring tribe, destroyed all the men
      and elders, and enslaved the women and children. From the standpoint of modern Christian morality, this is clearly
      villainy. But the descendants of this leader, centuries later, may proudly consider their ancestor a great conqueror.
      Thanks to his actions, their society was able to survive and prosper. Ironically, they pray to Jesus,
      who preached love and forgiveness.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Modern Parallels</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      In the modern world, methods of appropriating someone else's labor have become more sophisticated, but the essence remains the same.
      Corporations absorb small businesses, economically strong countries exploit the resources of the weak.
      This brings good to some and misery to others. Even within one group of people, what is good for one may
      be bad for another.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Boundaries of Good and Evil</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      So how do we define what is good for everyone? Everything is too situational and subjective. But let's
      look at it from another perspective: what is definitely evil?
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Death has always frightened people, and each person tries to compensate for this fear in their own way. Murder under certain
      conditions may be seen as good, but the death of all humanity is absolute evil. Actions
      that reduce humanity's chances of survival can be considered evil. Hence, everything that
      increases these chances is good.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Conclusion</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Therefore, I suggest we view moral questions through this lens: any action that contributes
      to the survival and flourishing of humanity can be considered good. This gives us a practical criterion
      for evaluating actions.
    </p>

    chapter2:`
    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Moral Dilemmas</h2>
    <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
      God, grant me the strength to overcome what is necessary,<br />
      God, grant me the humility to accept the inevitable,<br />
      And the wisdom to distinguish between the two.<br />
      <strong>— My interpretation of a well-known prayer.</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      At first glance, the statement that any actions that increase the chances of humanity's survival are good seems logical and pragmatic. 
      However, this statement requires a more detailed analysis.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Saving a Part of Society:</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      When it comes to humanity's survival, the situation can be quite straightforward. If the choice is between the extinction of all or saving 
      at least part of the reproductively capable population, then the good lies in saving this part. This may seem harsh, but in extreme situations, 
      such a choice becomes necessary. An example could be a global catastrophe scenario, where, in order to continue the human race, at least 
      a minimum number of people must be preserved.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Violation of Rights and Freedoms</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Definition of Freedom:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      The question of what freedom is is complex and multifaceted. In various situations, people are forced to sacrifice their rights and freedoms 
      for survival. At work, for example, we temporarily transfer some of our rights to our bosses to secure a livelihood.
      In different countries, there are restrictions on the display of certain body parts, and these restrictions vary depending on 
      cultural norms. People can only gain true freedom when they become independent from society, but this is unlikely in real 
      life conditions.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Long-term Consequences</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Unpredictability of the Future:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      We are not gods and cannot foresee all the consequences of our actions. Sometimes actions that seem good in the short term 
      can result in negative consequences in the future. However, this should not stop us from striving for survival.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Psychological and Sociocultural Aspects</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Culture and the Being of Society:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Culture, in essence, should serve the being of society, not be its foundation. Although the impoverishment of culture may seem 
      like an important issue, it should not overshadow the pursuit of survival. The most important aspect that deserves attention is 
      adherence to social justice. This is one of the cornerstones of society, and later in the book, we will examine it in more detail.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Thus, actions aimed at increasing the chances of humanity's survival can be considered good. 
      But unfortunately, we are not immediately able to definitively determine which actions lead to the desired result. 
      For that, we must use our reason to anticipate some problems.
